## Overview

The IPL First Innings Score Prediction project is a web application built using Flask. It predicts the possible score range for the first innings of an IPL match based on the given inputs. This application leverages a trained Linear Regression model to provide score predictions in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Predictions:** Enter match details to get an instant score range prediction.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with an intuitive interface to enhance the user experience.
- **Versatile Model:** The model considers various factors, including teams, overs, runs, and wickets.
- **Responsive Design:** Works smoothly across different devices.

## Live Demo

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-Learn
- Numpy & Pandas
- HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap (for UI)
- Gunicorn (for deployment)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IPL-Score-Prediction.git
   cd IPL-Score-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install the Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the App:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The app will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Enter the required inputs such as:
   - Batting Team
   - Bowling Team
   - Current Overs
   - Runs
   - Wickets
   - Runs scored in the last 5 overs
   - Wickets lost in the last 5 overs
3. Click on the **Predict Score** button.
4. The application will display the predicted score range for the first innings.

## Example
